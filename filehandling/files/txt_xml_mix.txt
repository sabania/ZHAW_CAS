In today's world, communication across different languages is essential. Consider the following XML snippet that represents a multilingual greeting system:

xml
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
<messages>
    <greeting lang="en">Hello, world!</greeting>
    <greeting lang="es">¡Hola, mundo!</greeting>
    <greeting lang="fr">Bonjour, le monde!</greeting>
</messages>
This structure allows applications to easily fetch a greeting based on the user's preferred language. For example, if a user selects Spanish, the system retrieves:

xml
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
<greeting lang="es">¡Hola, mundo!</greeting>
Such XML-based approaches are widely used in localization and internationalization of software applications.
